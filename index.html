      The Programming Languages Laboratory focuses on fundamental problems in
      programming languages. We are interested in addressing challenging
      problems which can also have practical impact within a ten year time
      frame. A common thread of much of our research is the extraction of static
      (compile-time) properties of programs. This can include type information,
      flow information, security information, and other program
      properties. Efforts involve both solving of fundamental problems, and
      implementation to justify the usefulness of the solution.
