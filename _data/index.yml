  The Programming Languages Laboratory focuses on fundamental problems in
  programming languages.

  We are interested in addressing challenging problems which can also have
  practical impact within a ten year time frame. A common thread of much of our
  research is the extraction of static (compile-time) properties of
  programs. This can include type information, flow information, security
  information, and other program properties.

  Efforts involve both solving of fundamental problems, and implementation to
  justify the usefulness of the solution.
