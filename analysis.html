<h2>Types for Program Analysis</h2>

Set constraint types are a generalization
of the standard notion of &quot;type&quot; to types which are sets of
constraints about program behavior.  Set constraints can capture more
details about the potential values that can be in a variable than a
traditional type system.  For instance, in an object-oriented language
such as Java, a variable declared as &quot;Serializable&quot; by the
Java type system can be any object which conforms to the Serializable
interface, but in practice that variable will only contain the
concrete objects which the program in fact serializes.  Knowing the
precise classes the program is serializing at that point is useful
both as a programming aid and as a tool to assist compilers in
generating faster code.  Recently we have developed and implemented a
tool which statically checks whether Java downcasts are legal using a
set-constraint-based mechanism.
<p>Type constraint systems are a very expressive form of type which can
be given to programs.  They are so expressive that they can in fact
fully record flow information about a program, namely this data value
could flow to that operation.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: The development of rich type constraint systems
for object-oriented programming languages.</p>  <p>
Our primary goal has been the extension of type constraint system to
allow for greater expressivity and usefulness in typing more
properties of programs. </p>

<blockquote><font size=-1>
Precise type information is invaluable for analysis and optimization
of object-oriented programs.  
Some forms of polymorphism found in
object-oriented languages pose significant difficulty for type inference, in
particular <em>data polymorphism</em>.  
Agesen's Cartesian Product
Algorithm (CPA) can analyze programs with parametric polymorphism in a
reasonably precise and efficient manner, but CPA loses precision for programs
with data polymorphism.  This paper presents a precise
constraint-based type inference system for Java.  It uses Data Polymorphic
CPA, a constraint-based type inference algorithm which extends CPA with the
ability to accurately and efficiently analyze data polymorphic
programs.  The system is implemented for the full Java language, and
is used to statically verify the correctness of Java downcasts. 
Benchmark results are given which show the system performs very well:
it is significantly more accurate and is nearly as efficient as CPA.
The implementation itself contains a number of novel optimizations 
which proved necessary to achieve scalability.</p>

<blockquote><font size=-1>
The basic idea behind improving the quality of a monovariant control
flow analysis such as 0CFA is the concept of <em>polyvariant</em>
analyses such as Agesen's Cartesian Product Algorithm (CPA) and
Shivers' <em>n</em>CFA.  In this paper we develop a novel framework for
polyvariant flow analysis based on Aiken-Wimmers constrained type
theory.  We develop instantiations of our framework to formalize
various polyvariant algorithms, including <em>n</em>CFA and CPA.  With our
CPA formalization, we show the call-graph based termination condition
for CPA will not always guarantee termination. We then develop a novel
termination condition and prove it indeed leads to a terminating
algorithm.  Additionally, we show how data polymorphism can be modeled
in the framework, by defining a simple extension to CPA that
incorporates data polymorphism.

<blockquote><font size=-1>
Constrained type systems are a natural generalization of 
Hindley/Milner type inference to languages with subtyping.
This paper develops several subtyping relations on constrained types.
We establish a full type abstraction property that equates an
operational notion of subtyping with a semantic notion based on
regular trees.  The decidability of this notion of subtyping is open;
we present a decidable approximation.  Subtyping constrained types has
application to functor signature matching.
