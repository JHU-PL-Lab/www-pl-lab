The goal of this project is the development of rigorous semantic foundations for
actor computation.

Here are a few features of the models we developed.

- A rigorous reworking of the Actor model of computation
- Operational semantics of executions given.
- Only fair executions considered, for unfair executions never arise in
  practice.
- Observational equivalence and methods for proving observational equivalence in
  the presence of fairness are defined.
- Explicit, dynamic modeling of external agents and their interactions.
