Welcome to the home of the Backstage Java (BSJ) project. BSJ is a Java language
extension which demonstrates the utility of _difference-based metaprogramming_,
a [metaprogramming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming) model in which
metaprograms are treated as difference generators rather than program
transformation functions. Difference-based metaprogramming lends itself to
developing independent metaprogramming modules which are easy to reason about
but are powerful enough to express complex object-oriented programming patterns.

For a brief and light tutorial on BSJ, please see the
[tutorial page](/projects/bsj/tutorial/).
