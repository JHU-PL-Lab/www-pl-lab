Specification diagrams are a graphical notation for the specification of
distributed systems. The primary design goal is to make a form of notation for
defining message-passing behavior that is very expressive, intuitively
understandable, and that has a fully formal underlying semantics.

Specification diagrams are two-dimensional graphical structures. Many
specification languages that have achieved widespread usage have a graphical
foundation: engineers can understand and communicate more effectively by
graphical means. Popular graphical specification languages include Universal
Modelling Language (UML) and its predecessors, and StateCharts. Specification
diagrams aim to be a language with similar intuitive advantage but significantly
greater expressivity and formal underpinnings.

Specification diagrams are highly suited to protocol specification because they
give a formal specification of the protocol that is also readable by
implementers. We have specified various security protocols, including the
Needham-Schroeder protocol and TLS.
