This line of research addresses foundational issues in operational
semantics. The main thrust has been to show how denotational concepts such as
pre-ordering on elements, directed set, least fixed-point, fixed point
induction, finite/compact/algebraic elements, and ideal models of types can be
"ported" to a purely operational semantic development. The goal of this research
is to give full and faithful semantics to languages for which denotational
semantics falls short.

  This paper presents the operational theory for a pure functional language.

  extended version, but this paper is generally subsumed by the previous)

  This paper studies how more complex languages may be fully and faithfully
  embedded in simpler ones. By such embeddings, some results which hold for
  purely functional languages can be lifted to languages with state and
  objects. A conjecture is given on how to characterize the finite or compact
  elements for a language with state; the problem remains open however.

  logic for a programming language with state.
